  description: I've always wanted to work on games since I was a little kid and this degree felt like the first stepping stone to do that.
               During my time as a C. S. bachelor, I learned a lot about programming and engineering as a whole.
               Those skills still to this day have helped me in my career as a Game Designer and Indie Game Developer.
               After finishing this degree I had a lot of connections in the departement which obfuscated my game developing dreams.
               Thus I started the Master's Degree on this same field. 
               Later, as I was working on my dissertation, I realised that I was not passionate about Computer Science.
               It was then that I decided to switch my whole focus into getting in the Master's Degree for Design and Development of Digital Games.

  description: Designing games had always been my passion. I remember as a little kids how much I loved creating games in my head.
               It took me a while to understand that this was the path I wanted in life.
               Now that I've studied so much about the area, learning a lot about each of the different parts of the development team, I feel as though I am ready to take my first steps in the Game Industry.
